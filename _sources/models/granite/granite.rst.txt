Granite run alone
=================

We can do exactly the same with Granite as :doc:`we did with SmolVLM <../../index>`.

The code is mostly the same (just change the ```---model``` argument), but the scripts to run Granite are slightly different.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Granite run on a single image <extract>
   Prompts used to control the extraction <../smolvlm/prompts>
   Plot extracted vs image data <../gemma/plot_image+extracted>
   Granite run on a set of images <extract_multi>
   Plot success percentages from a model <../gemma/plot_stats>
